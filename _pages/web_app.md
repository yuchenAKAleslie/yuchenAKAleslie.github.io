We have created an integrated web application for facilitating tunneling squeezing hazard analysis and uncertainty-informed engineering decision making. Currently, it is hosted on PythonAnywhere.

### front-end for deploying Bayesian deep learning models

We have discussed about a few ways to deploy the learned Machine Learning models. The most convenient and visualised way is through a web-based application where users can interact with anytime anywhere. Shown below, I have created such an web application to display the uncertainty along with the squeezing prediction. Two types of prediction are supported, users can either type in the input feaures or directly compute with a grouped data set and additional obtain more overall insights (as in metrics and figures.)

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/predict_page.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
