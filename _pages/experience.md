### Teaching

- Teaching Assistant (TA) for the module Geophysical Project (ENVS300) of Univ of Liverpool;
- Supervising an undergraduate Stephen Guerin with dissertation "_Using machine learning to forecast induced seismicity_"

***

### Secondment

- 2022 Jan - June, <a href="https://www.isterre.fr/">Isterre</a>, <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/">Université Grenoble Alpes (UGA)</a>, France. 

I embarked on a collaboration work with Prof. Philippe Guéguen in an [uncertainty-informed approach for structural damage detection with envrionmental factors]({% link _projects/5_project.md %}).
