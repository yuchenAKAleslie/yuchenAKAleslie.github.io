PhD candidate, <a href='https://riskinstitute.uk'>Institute for Risk and Unceratinty, University of Liverpool</a>;

ESR, MSCA-ITN project <a href="https://urbasis-eu.osug.fr">URBASIS</a>.



During my PhD, I am dedicated to Developing a computational framework to deal with bad data (limited, sparse or corrupted data), and propagate those uncertainty through different models in an efficient way, using probabilistic Deep Learning and imprecise probability.

#### Research interests
```markdown
- **{Bayesian, knowledge-informed, generative}** Deep Learning
- Stochastic modeling of uncertainties in engineering
- Imprecise probability
- Risk-based optimal decision making and cost-benefit analysis
```
