Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

During my PhD, I am dedicated to Developing a computational framework to deal with bad data (limited, sparse or corrupted data), and propagate those uncertainty through different models in an efficient way, using probabilistic Deep Learning and imprecise probability.

### Research interests
- {**Bayesian, physics-informed, generative**} Deep Learning
- Stochastic modeling of uncertainties in engineering
- Imprecise probability
- Risk-based optimal decision making and cost-benefit analysis
