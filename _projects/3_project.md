Building on the universal approximator thoery, deep neural network models are trained to construct functional mappings through learning with abundant observed samples. However, in many situations, observations can be imprecise, noisy and even incomplete. These data problems raise challenges in learning the underlying data generating process and also conducting reliable generalisation at testing stage. 

For example, training data may often include interval-valued data, which may be caused by imperfection of measurement tools or imprecision of expert information, or from [missing data](./_projects/1_project.md). Interval training sets may also arise in situations of specific grouped representation such as such as daily interval stock prices.
