## Introduction

Stochastic processes are widely adopted in many domains to deal with problems which are stochastic in nature and involve strong nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and uncertain system problems[^1]. Capturing the nonstationarity plays a central role in characterising many environmental processes (e.g. earthquake ground motion or wind) and realistically reflect the response process of engineering structures under stochastic excitations[^2].

## formulation
In this section, a brief review of the theory of the spectral representation of stochastic processes (stationary and non-stationary) is outlined. In particular, focus is on power spectral estimation and simulation of the corresponding processes.
A general non-stationary random process, with respect to a family of oscillatory functions, can be represented in the form:

$$
X_{t} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} A(\omega, t) e^{i \omega t} \text{d} Z(\omega)
$$   

where $$\phi_{t}(\omega)= A(\omega, t) e^{i \omega t}$$ represent the oscillatory functions, of which $$A(\omega, t)$$ suggests a slowly varying and frequency-dependent modulating function and $Z(\omega)$ is an orthogonal process; $$\{X_{t}\}$$ is termed as oscillatory processes whose (two-sided) evolutionary power spectral density is further given as:

$$
S(\omega, t) = |A(\omega, t)|^2 S(\omega)
$$    

where $$S(\omega)$$ represents the power spectral density function in the case of a stationary process with a family of complex exponentials, i.e., $$\phi_{t}(\omega)=e^{i \omega t}$$. The semi-stationary property due to the slowly-changing spectra premise facilitates the practical estimation of the evolutionary spectra given a realization record via non-stationary time-frequency methods, e.g. wavelet transforms. Inversely, a versatile formula for generating sample realizations compatible with the stochastic process is given by spectral representation method (SRM):

$$
x^{(i)}(t) = \sqrt{2} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sqrt{2 S(\omega_{n}, t) \Delta \omega} \cos(\omega_{n} t + \Phi^{(i)}_{n})
$$


where $$x^{(i)}(t)$$ is a sample simulation, $\Phi^{(i)}$ is the set of independent random phase angles, distributed uniformly over the interval $$[0, 2 \pi]$$, for the $i$th sample realizations; $$N$$ and $$\Delta{\omega}$$ relate to the discretization of the frequency domain.
